Tarot is a game for three to five players that uses a 78-card deck with 21 trumps, one fool and four suits. The goal is to score points by taking tricks with valuable cards or by fulfilling a contract that you bid at the beginning of the round. The contracts range from taking the majority of the points in the tricks, to taking all of them, to not taking any. The game involves strategy, bluffing and cooperation with your partner or partners.
 
Belote is a game for four players in two teams that uses a 32-card deck with four suits. The goal is to score points by taking tricks with valuable cards or by making announcements such as sequences or sets of cards. The game involves strategy, memory and communication with your partner. The highest card in each suit changes depending on which suit is chosen as the trump suit at the beginning of the round.
 
Coinche is a variant of belote that adds more complexity and challenge to the game. In coinche, you can bid higher than your opponents to win the right to choose the trump suit and the contract. You can also coinche or surcoinche their bids to challenge them and increase the stakes. The game involves more strategy, bluffing and risk-taking than belote.
